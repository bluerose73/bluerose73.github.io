ðŸš§ This Post is under Construction ðŸš§

When I was new to C++, like many beginners, I coded [the entire program in a single source file](https://github.com/bluerose73/Amazon-chess). It took me 3 years to finally figure out how to make a "project" with multiple source files, a meaningful directory structure, and an automated build process. I found that beginner-level C++ "project structure" tutorials are surprisingly few on the internet, so I wrote this post in hope it would help C++ beginners like me in the past.

This post is intended for C++ beginners who are able to write small programs of 50~200 lines (like solving problems in LeetCode), and want to build something bigger.

After reading this post, you will be able to
- Split your code into multiple sources and headers
- Elegantly arrange the files into a tree structure
- Automate build process with CMake
- Power up your project with third-party libraries

## Sources and Headers

## Project Directory Structure

## Building with CMake
